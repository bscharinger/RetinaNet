Object Detection with RetinaNet trained on the COCO 2017 Dataset. RetinaNet is a single-stage object detector using a feature pyramid network on top of a ResNet50 backbone and uses Focal loss and Smooth L1 loss.

Retina Net was introduced by Lin et. al., their paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)

This is a work in progress
